        Thank you for your interest in taking part in this study. It will be looking at developing
        an accurate psychometric test of musical vertical processing ability in the general
        population. Your participation entails filling in a short form asking about a few basic
        personal details, general musical ability, and any conditions which may affect your
        performance in the test, followed by taking the vertical processing test, which will ask
        you to identify how many notes are in a played chord followed by singing the notes
        that you hear. There will be a short debrief at the end of the test.
